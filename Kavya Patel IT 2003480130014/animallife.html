          <h1> Origin </h1>
          <p><i><h4>The word "animal" comes from the Latin animalis, meaning 'having breath', <br>'having soul' or 'living being'.
            Sponges were among the earliest animals. </h4><br> </i></p>

        <p><h4>
           <i> All animals and plants are classified as multicellular eukaryotes: their bodies are made up of large numbers of cells,</i> and microscopic inspection of these cells reveals that <br><br> they contain a nucleus and a number of other organelles.
            Compared to prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria, plants and animals have a relatively recent<br><br> evolutionary origin.
            DNA evidence suggests that the <i>first eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotes, between 2500 and 1000 million years ago. </i>That is, eukaryotes as a taxon<br><br> date from the Proterozoic Era, the final Era of the Precambrian. Fossils of both simple unicellular
            and more complex multicellular organisms are found in abundance<br><br> in rocks from this period of time. In fact, the name <i>"Proterozoic" means "early life".</i>
            Plants and animals both owe their origins to endosymbiosis, a process where one <br><br> cell ingests another, but for some reason then fails to digest it. The evidence for this lies in the way their cells function.
             Both plant and animal rely on structures called<br><br> mitochondria to release energy in their cells, using aerobic respiration to produce the energy-carrying molecule ATP.</i><br><br></h4>

            <h4>
            Whatever their origins, animals may have ventured onto land early in the Cambrian. 
            Previously scientists believed that animals did not begin to colonise the land until<br><br> the Silurian (440 - 410 million years ago). However,<i> the 2002 discovery of the footprints of animals that scuttled about on sand dunes about 530 million years ago </i>has<br><br> changed this view. 
            These animals were arthropods, and resembled centipedes about the size of crayfish. They probably didn't live on land, instead coming ashore to<br><br> mate or evade predators. At this time the only land plants appear to have resembled mosses .
