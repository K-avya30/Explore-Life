    <i>Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes,</i> from that which does not, and is defined by the <br><br>capacity for growth, reaction to stimuli, metabolism, energy transformation, and reproduction.<br><br> Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. Biology is the science that studies life.

    The gene is the unit of heredity, whereas<br><br>the cell is the structural and functional unit of life.<br><br>There are two kinds of cells, <i>prokaryotic</i> and <i>eukaryotic,</i> both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as<br><br> proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce through a process of cell division, in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells and passes its genes onto <br><br>a new generation, sometimes producing genetic variation.<br><br>

    Organisms, or the individual entities of life, are generally thought to be open systems that maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo <br><br>metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve over multiple generations.<br><br>Other definitions sometimes include non-cellular life forms such as viruses and viroids, but they are usually excluded because they do not function on their own<br><br>rather, they exploit the biological processes of hosts.<br><br>

   <i>Abiogenesis, also known as the Origin of Life, is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter,</i> such as simple organic compounds. Since its primordial<br><br> beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale, but it has also adapted to survive in most ecosystems and conditions.<br><br>New lifeforms have evolved from common ancestors through hereditary variation and natural selection, and today, estimates of the number of distinct species range<br><br>anywhere from 3 million to over 100 million.<br><br>

    <i>Death</i> is the permanent termination of all biological processes which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life. <i>Extinction</i> is the term describing the dying-<br><br>out of a group or taxon, usually a species. <i>Fossils</i> are the preserved remains or traces of organisms.</h4>
