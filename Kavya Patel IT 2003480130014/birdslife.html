          <p><i><h4>Birds are the most accomplished aeronauts the world has ever seen. <br>They fly high and low, at great speed, and very slowly. And always with extraordinary precision and control.</h4><br> </i></p>

        <p><h4>Getting into the air is by far the most exhausting of a bird's activities, and Attenborough observes shearwaters in Japan that have taken to climbing trees to give them a <br><br> good jumping-off point. 
          <i>The albatross is so large that it can only launch itself after a run-up to create a flow of air over its wings.</i> A combination of aerodynamics and <br><br> upward air currents (or thermals), 
          together with the act of flapping or gliding is what keeps a bird aloft. Landing requires
          less energy but a greater degree of skill,<br><br>
          particularly for a big bird, such as a swan. Weight is kept to a minimum by having a beak made of keratin instead of bone, a light frame, and a coat of feathers, which<br><br> 
          is maintained fastidiously.<i> The peregrine falcon holds the record for being fastest in the air, diving at speeds of over 300 km/h. </i>Conversely, the barn owl owes its<br><br> predatory success to flying slowly,
           while the kestrel spots its quarry by hovering. However,
          <i>the true specialists in this regard are the hummingbirds, whose wings beat<br><br> at the rate of 25 times a second. </i>The habits of migratory birds are explored.<br><br>
          Bird Life Cycle Stages<br><br>
           Stage 1 - The Egg
          All birds start their lives inside an egg; for the most part, which is a white, yellow, hard-shell covering the outside of the developing bird's<br><br> undeveloped embryo.<br><br>
          Stage 2 - The Hatching<br><br>
          After the bird has come out of the egg, the newly hatched bird is known as a hatchling.<br><br>
          Stage 3 - The Nestling<br><br>
          In this stage, the bird attempts to fly and shows certain flight qualities.<br><br>
          Stage 4 - The Fledgeling<br><br>
          A fledgeling has completely developed plumes and solid muscle wings.<br><br>
          Stage 5 - The Juvenile<br><br>
          Juvenile birds leave the nest and are free to fly.<br><br>
          Stage 6 - The Sub Adult<br><br>
          In this stage, the young birds are yet not completely grown as they don't have adult plumage.<br><br>
          Stage 7 - The Adult<br><br>
          The adult bird has conclusive plumage and is explicitly mature.<br><br>
